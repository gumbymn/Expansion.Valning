## Valning Map (Expansion Ready)
*Thank you to Avoka for use of his Valning Map, as well as the DayZ Expansion Team, for without these, this project would not be possible.*

## Installation
To install this, you must have the following mods installed on the server:
* Community Framework (CF) by Jacob_Mango
* Community Online Tools (COT) by Jacob_Mango
* DayZ-Expansion or DayZ-Expansion-Experimental (Version is tested on both) by DayZ Expansion
* DayZ-Expansion-Licensed or DayZ-Licensed-Experimental (Version is tested on both) by DayZ Expansion
* Valning Map by Avoka

Download the map from [here](https://github.com/gumbymn/Expansion.Valning/blob/master/latest.zip) and install the map under the ```mpmissions``` folder of your server. Under the ```serverDZ.cfg``` change the template to ```Expansion.Valning``` and save. This will force the server to load the Valning Map. 

*Note, some providers such as Nitrado may experience issues with this, and as such Nitrado is not supported by me (gumbymn).*

You must download the key from the [Valning Map](https://discord.gg/ab7yX9b) Discord and install it into the ```@Valning Map``` folder. Launch DayZ using your favorite launcher (DayZ Standalone, DZSALauncher, Magic Launcher) and connect to your favorite server.
