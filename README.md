# Valning Map (Expansion Ready) <br>![Build](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-v1.8121223-orange) 
*Thank you to Avoka for use of his Valning Map, as well as the DayZ Expansion Team, for without these, this project would not be possible.*

## Installation

To install this, you must have the following mods installed on the server:
* Community Framework (CF) by Jacob_Mango
* Community Online Tools (COT) by Jacob_Mango
* DayZ-Expansion by DayZ Expansion
* DayZ-Expansion-Licensed by DayZ Expansion
* BuilderStatics by Not A Banana
* BuilderItems by Not A Banana (Future Version will remove this as included in expansion)
* Valning Map by Avoka

<sub>**Note: This is compatible with DayZ-Expansion experimental**</sub>

Download the map from [here](https://github.com/gumbymn/Expansion.Valning/blob/master/latest.zip) and install the map under the ```mpmissions``` folder of your server. Under the ```serverDZ.cfg``` change the template to ```Expansion.Valning``` and save. This will force the server to load the Valning Map. 

**Note, some providers such as Nitrado may experience issues with this, and as such Nitrado is not supported by me (gumbymn).**

Copy and extract the ```Missions``` and ```Settings``` folders from [here](https://github.com/gumbymn/Expansion.Valning/tree/source) to your ```ServerProfiles\ExpansionMod``` folder (some hosts may use a different folder name).

You must download the key from the [Valning Map](https://discord.gg/ab7yX9b) Discord and install it into the ```@Valning Map``` and ```keys``` folders. Start the server. Launch DayZ using your favorite launcher (DayZ Standalone, DZSALauncher, Magic Launcher) and connect to your favorite server.

This mission also has an offline version which can be found [here](https://gumbymn.github.io/ExpansionCOM.Valning/).

## Current Issues
